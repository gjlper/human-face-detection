# human-face-detection
Implemented AdaBoost and RealBoost algorithms from scratch for human face detection.
Use Haar filters as week classifiers. Use hard negatives to improve model performance.
Plot ROC curves and histograms of positive and negative populations to compare algorithm performance.

Dataset:

Training data: Face and non-face images of size 16x16 pixels.

Testing data: Photos taken for testing.

Hard negatives: Background images taken without faces.
